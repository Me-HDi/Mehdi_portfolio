# On-Time Delivery Dashboard  
As an intern at a manufacturing company, I created this interactive dashboard for the management in order to better understand and monitor its behavior in terms of production lead-times and delays incurred by customers. This dashboard helps especially the customer service department offer more accurate delivery dates for customers. It also alerts the production department about product lines having unusual lead-times.
The visualized variables : actual production lead-time, lead-time requested by customers, delay from due delivery date, delay from requested delivery date.
